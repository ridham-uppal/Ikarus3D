# **AI-Powered Furniture Recommendation Web App**

This project is a full-stack web application that uses a multi-modal AI model to provide furniture recommendations based on natural language queries. It combines machine learning, NLP, and computer vision with a modern web stack to deliver an interactive user experience. The application also features a data analytics dashboard to visualize insights from the product catalog.

## 🌐 **Live Demo**

The frontend of this project is deployed and available here:  
👉 [**ikarus-nu.vercel.app**](https://ikarus-nu.vercel.app/)

> **Note:** The backend, ML model pipeline, and vector database are **not hosted** due to time constraints and infrastructure limitations.  
> The backend requires a **paid deployment solution** because of large model dependencies and database size.  
> However, the **entire backend and ML pipeline can be run locally** by following the setup instructions below.

## **Project Overview**

The core of this application is a recommendation engine that understands both the text descriptions and the images of furniture items. When a user enters a query like "a modern wooden desk for a small office," the system finds the most relevant products by comparing the query's meaning to the combined text and image data of each item in the database.

The project is composed of four main parts:

1. **React Frontend:** A clean, responsive user interface with two main pages for product recommendations and data analytics.  
2. **FastAPI Backend:** A high-performance API server that handles user requests, communicates with the machine learning models, and serves data to the frontend.  
3. **ML/AI Pipeline:** A set of Python notebooks for data analysis, model training, and embedding generation using Hugging Face Transformers (CLIP & TinyLlama).  
4. **Vector Database (Pinecone):** A specialized database used to store and efficiently search through high-dimensional vector embeddings of the furniture products.

## **Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.10+  
* Node.js v18+ and npm  
* A Pinecone account (the free tier is sufficient)

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ikarus-project
2. Set Up the Backend
Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file inside the backend/ directory.
Add your Pinecone API key to this file:
PINECONE_API_KEY="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
3. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
cd frontend

Install Dependencies:
npm install

Running the Application
The application requires three main steps to run: populating the database, starting the backend, and starting the frontend.

Step 1: Run the ML Notebook
You must first run the model_training.ipynb notebook to process the dataset and populate your Pinecone vector database.

Open the notebooks/ directory.
Run all cells in model_training.ipynb. This will:
Load the dataset from data/.
Download the required AI models.
Generate embeddings for all products.
Connect to your Pinecone account and upload the embeddings.
Note: This process can take a significant amount of time, depending on your hardware.
Step 2: Start the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend/ directory.

Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated.

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

The backend API will now be running at http://1227.0.0.1:8000.

Step 3: Start the Frontend Application
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend/ directory.

Start the React development server:
npm start

The application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

You can now interact with the web app, search for products, and view the analytics dashboard!
